This application explores the Collatz Conjecture, also known as the "3n + 1 problem," through interactive visualizations. The application allows users to input a starting integer value (n) and a multiplier (m), subsequently generating a sequence according to the Collatz rules. These sequences are visualized through sequence plots and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots to assess their distribution's normality compared to a theoretical normal distribution.  
Since this is an interactive application using shiny we request you to download the code and run it in R to run the application.  
Also make sure you have the following libraries installed before execution of the code:   
**'shiny'**   
**'plotly'**   
**'RColorBrewer'**
