This application to exploring the Collatz Conjecture, also known as the "3n + 1 problem," through interactive visualizations. The application allows users to input a starting integer value and a multiplier, subsequently generating a sequence according to the Collatz rules. These sequences are visualized through sequence plots and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots to assess their distribution's normality compared to a theoretical normal distribution.
